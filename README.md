Beginner data analytics project analyzing customer shopping behavior using Python and SQL.
# Customer Shopping Behaviour Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using a structured dataset. The goal is to understand purchasing patterns, customer demographics, and spending trends through data analysis and visualization.

The project was completed as part of a **guided YouTube tutorial** to gain hands-on experience in data analytics tools and workflows, including Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (public dataset)
- Type: Structured tabular data
- Description: Contains customer details, product categories, purchase amounts, and transaction-related information.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Power BI**
- **Gamma** 

## Project Workflow / Steps
1. Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas  
2. Performed data cleaning:
   - Handled missing values
   - Removed inconsistencies
3. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Analyzed customer demographics
   - Studied spending behavior and product categories
4. Imported cleaned data into PostgreSQL
5. Wrote SQL queries to extract meaningful insights
6. Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI
7. Created a report and presentation using Gamma

## Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize:
- Customer spending patterns
- Category-wise sales distribution
- Key trends and insights


## Results & Insights
- Identified key customer segments based on spending behavior
- Observed trends in product category preferences
- Gained insights into overall purchasing patterns

This project helped strengthen my understanding of data cleaning, SQL querying, and data visualization.
